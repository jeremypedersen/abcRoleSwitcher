# ABC Role Switcher

Easily switch between RAM Roles on Alibaba Cloud using this handy browser extension, available for both Chrome and Firefox.

## Installation

Coming soon! Right now this repo is a placeholder as I work out kinks in the code! 

## Configuration

Right click on the browser plugin icon (upper right hand corner in Chrome), then left click on `Configuration`. Enter your RAM Role information into the textbox on the left hand side of the configuration page, then click save. See below for a more detailed explanation.

You can specify multiple roles, using either the role_arn or role_name plus account ID. You can also specify a few optional parameters (see below).

#### Optional parameters
