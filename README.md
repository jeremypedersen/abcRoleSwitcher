# ABC Role Switcher

Easily switch between RAM Roles on Alibaba Cloud using this handy browser extension, available for both Chrome and Firefox (well, *soon* anyway).

## Installation

Coming soon! Right now this repo is a placeholder as I work out kinks in the code! 

## Configuration

Right click on the browser plugin icon (upper right hand corner in Chrome), then left click on `Configuration`. Enter your RAM Role information into the textbox on the left hand side of the configuration page, then click save. See below for a more detailed explanation.

You can specify multiple roles, using either the role_arn or role_name plus account ID. You can also specify a few optional parameters (see below).

#### Optional parameters

Color: A color which will be displayed around the top of the Alibaba Cloud console menu bar, allowing you to visually differentiate roles.

## Donations

Please direct donations to *tilfin*, who inspired this role switcher plugin with his incredible *AWS Extend Switch Roles* plugin for AWS. You can donate to his project [here](https://github.com/tilfin/aws-extend-switch-roles).

## Appearance
